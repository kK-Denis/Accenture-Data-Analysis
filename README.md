# Accenture-Data-Analysis
This work is the product of participation in a simulation of tasks at Accenture North America
The tasks entailed;
- taking 7 datasets that are part of the _Social Buzz_ data model,
- identifying and cleaning those needed for further analysis,
- transforming and priming the data in the 3 target datasets,
- and answering the questions posed about the data.
The approach employed in this endeavor was the use of Python and Pandas, 
deployed in a Jupyter Notebook for interactivity.
Python and Pandas, as oppossed to MS Excel as recommended in the project prompt,
facilitates the use of code as opposed to manual manipulation of a desktop app
the consequence of which is a notebook that could be deployed on similar datasets,
and more so automated and scaled to suit other projects and analytics needs.
